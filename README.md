<h2>The #AADHum2018 Repository</h2>
<h4>Created and maintained by <a href="mailto:jhl.jessica@gmail.com">Jessica H. Lu</a>, Ph.D., University of Maryland</h4>

<p>This repository has been created to introduce researchers, scholars, and community members to scholarly text encoding for primary documents in African American history and culture, in an interactive pre-conference held at the University of Maryland, College Park, MD, USA. These materials are intended to serve as instructional examples that prompt discussion about how encoding can be "<a href="https://aadhum.umd.edu/conference/" target="blank">intentionally digital, intentionally Black</a>."</p>

Slides for the pre-conference can be found <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1z9d3JVjva8fm41yZtSCJYYXEghHpI759Nf66g6AH3Ao/edit?usp=sharing">here</a>.
